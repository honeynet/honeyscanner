# Honeyscanner

Honeyscanner is a vulnerability analyzer for honeypots. It is designed to automatically perform attacks against a given honeypot to determine the likelihood of an attacker pivoting from the honeypot to the real corporate network. The analyzer uses a variety of attacks, ranging from exploiting vulnerable software libraries to DoS, and fuzzing attacks. In the end, an evaluation report is provided to the honeypot administrator, including advice on how to enhance the security of the honeypot.
